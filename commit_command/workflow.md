*The following example assumes that we edited some content in a file called hello.md on the current branch, and are ready to commit it to the project history.*

1. First, we need to stage the file with git add, then we can commit the staged snapshot.

**`git add hello.md`**

This command will add hello.md to the Git staging area. 

2. We can examine the result of this action by using the git status command.

**`git status`**

`On branch master
    Changes to be committed:
       (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
           new file: hello.md`

 *hello.md indicates that hello.md will be saved with the next commit.*

 3. From the commit is created by executing

  **`git commit`**

 This will open a text editor (customizable via git config) asking for a commit log message, along with a list of whatâ€™s being committed:

`Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
    with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit
      On branch master
        Changes to be committed:
          use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage
             modified: hello.md`
