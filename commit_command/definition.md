# **GIT COMMIT COMMAND**

The git commit command will save all staged changes, along with a brief description from the user, in a “commit” to the local repository.
Commits are at the heart of Git usage. You can think of a commit as a snapshot of your project, where a new version of that project is created in the current repository. 

## **FEATURES OF COMMIT COMMAND**

**1.** *you can recall the commited changes at a later date, or revert the project to that version.*

**2.** *if multiple commits edit different parts of the project, they will not overwrite each other even if the authors of the commit were unaware of each other. This is one of the benefits of using Git over a tool like Dropbox or Google Drive.*

**3. SYNTAX**

`git commit -m 'task/feature: message'`
