Creating a directory using Git Bash is just a simple command which is used in Linux systems also. Although you can create the directory using

*Note: It is worth noting that ls won’t show the hidden folders. You need to use ls -a for the same.*

### You can remove a directory by using `rmdir` command with the directory name.

### *Note: mk stands for Make and rm stands for Remove*
