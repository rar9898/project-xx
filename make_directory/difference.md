# **Difference between mkdir and git init**

## Both are tools, but used for quite different purposes, although complementary.

## `mkdir` just creates a plain old directory at the given path / name.

## `git init` will prepare a directory for revision control, creating a .git directory with the history of your files, if you commit them regularly.

## In any case, mkdir creates a new empty directory.

## git init, given in a directory (which doesnâ€™t have to be empty, by the way) creates a git repository in that directory.

# **What does mkdir command do?**

## The mkdir command is is used to create new directories. A directory, referred to as a folder in some operating systems, appears to the user as a container for other directories and files.

# **What is P in mkdir?**

## The `-p` will create the directory(along with the directories that lead to the directory you want to create) and would ignore any errors if the directory already exists. It is a argument/tag used in operating systems that are like unix or based on it.
