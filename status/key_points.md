# ** DEFINING GIT STATUS**

## The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history. For this, you need to use `git log`.

# **USAGE**

## `git status`

## *List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked.*
