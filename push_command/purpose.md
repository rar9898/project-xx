# **The Purpose of Git Push command**

## In its simplest definition, the Git push command can be taken as uploading the content to the remote repository.

## After adding a feature, making changes or other tasks in the local repository, you may use the push command for uploading these changes to the remote repository (e.g. Github) so other team members can see it and may update their project accordingly.

## A simple example of using the push command can be:

`**$ git push origin master**`
